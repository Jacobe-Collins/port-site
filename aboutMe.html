        <p><Span>H</Span>ello My name is Jacobe Collins and I am a beginner Software Engineer. I am currently self studying using course materials from Codecademy. I have completed many projects and I am on my way to becoming a production level engineer. I regularly update this site to showcase my skills as they grow in hopes that you will see my value as a programmer. I believe myself to be a dedicated, focused, and hard working individual. Thank you for taking the time to review what I have to offer and please feel free to contact me for more info on how to employ my services.</p>
